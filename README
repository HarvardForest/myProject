myProject
=========

Example of how one might structure the computational part of a
project, largely derived from a great article by Noble (2009).

*Basic Project*

README: introduce a naive user to the project
LICENSE: explicit statement of how the project components can be used
data: files containing raw data, use scripts for calculations
src: functions for analyses should live here
doc: documents, such as manuscripts and summaries related to the project
results: scripts and their output are kept in here in appropriate sub-folders
